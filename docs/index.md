# Welcome!

I am **Vinicius Agostini**, a **Machine Learning Engineer** ðŸ’» with a heavy bias towards the software engineering aspect of it.

I am interested in topics that range from coding best practices in ML to microservices and event-driven systems. I also have a small background in competitive programming from my early college years.

This is a collection of anything that I want to write about. The reasoning
for the posts here are not only to share my knowledge but also to serve the
purpose of making me write about what I'm learning or practicing.

Take everything with a grain of salt, I may be wrong and will eventually try
to correct and improve posts over time. The posts should not be viewed
as final or absolute truth.
